I recently faced this error "no space left on device", on checking the space left on the disk it was more than enough.

The system was maxing out on memory at some point, I suspected it to be a resource issue. We added more RAM, CPU and mounted a new disk.

The article below will be on the actions we did, and maybe find out if it was the right thing to do or not.
